    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: <strong>2025-12-10</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Matter Matters</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information in connection with the Matter Matters mobile application (the "App") and the Matter Matters website at <a href="https://matter-matters.org">https://matter-matters.org</a> (the "Website"). Our organization is a nonprofit focused on materials education and sustainability.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & contact information:</strong> name, email address, and other contact details you submit via the App or the Website's contact or subscription forms. (For example: email subscription and contact form present on the Website.)</li>
      <li><strong>Usage information:</strong> information about how you use the App and Website (pages viewed, features used, timestamps).</li>
      <li><strong>Device & technical data:</strong> device model, operating system version, app version, unique device identifiers, and IP address.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> any messages you send to us through the contact form or in-App messaging, including message content and attachments.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies & similar technologies:</strong> cookies, local storage, and similar technologies may be used to improve the App and Website experience (see the Cookies section below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App and Website;</li>
      <li>Respond to your inquiries and communications;</li>
      <li>Send you updates, newsletters, and other communications if you opt in to receive them;</li>
      <li>Improve and personalize our services, content, and user experience;</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities to protect the App and Website and to prevent abuse;</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction with data protection laws that require us to state a legal basis, we rely on the following bases where appropriate: your consent (for newsletters or optional features), the necessity to perform a contract or provide a service, our legitimate interests (for improving services, analytics, and preventing abuse), or compliance with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may disclose information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services for us (e.g., hosting, email delivery, analytics).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> if required by law, or to protect our rights or safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a sale, merger, reorganization, or similar transaction involving the App or Website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services & Hosting</h2>
    <p>The Website indicates it is built on WordPress and references WordPress.com features. As a result, portions of the Website may be hosted or supported by WordPress.com or related services. Please note that use of third-party services may involve transfer of data to those providers. </p>
    <p>Please review the privacy policies of any third-party services we use (e.g., WordPress.com, email providers, analytics platforms) for more information about their data handling practices.</p>

    <h2>6. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>We and our third-party partners may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and similar technologies to collect usage and device information, to remember user preferences, and to help deliver targeted content and measure performance. You can manage cookie settings through your device or browser controls. If you opt out of certain analytics or advertising cookies, some App or Website features may be affected.</p>

    <h2>7. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
    <p>We may use analytics services to understand how our App and Website are used. Where required by law or platform rules, we will ask for your consent before enabling analytics that are not strictly necessary. We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy (including to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements). Specific retention periods depend on the type of data and the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may have rights including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to the personal data we hold about you;</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate data;</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your personal data;</li>
      <li>Request restriction of, or object to, processing;</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent where we rely on it;</li>
      <li>Data portability requests where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact details below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.</p>

    <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App and Website are not directed at children under the age of 13 (or higher age in jurisdictions where the age is different). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Information we collect may be processed in countries other than your own. We will take appropriate steps to protect personal data transferred across borders, including contractual protections where required.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top. If we make material changes, we will post notice in the App or Website or send you a direct notice if appropriate.</p>
